# Project-Phase-I2025-26


Project Overview
This project is a Smart Agriculture Decision Support System that uses **multiple Machine Learning models** to help farmers make better farming decisions.  
The system provides recommendations related to **crop selection, fertilizer usage, irrigation, disease prediction, pest risk prediction, and pest prevention**.

The goal of this project is to improve crop yield, reduce losses, and support sustainable farming practices using data-driven intelligence.



 Modules and Functionalities

This project consists of **five different Machine Learning models**, each performing a specific task:

 1. Crop Recommendation Model
- Recommends the most suitable crop based on:
  - Soil nutrients (N, P, K)
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - pH value
  - Rainfall
- Helps farmers choose the right crop for maximum yield.

---

 2. Fertilizer Recommendation Model
- Suggests the appropriate fertilizer based on:
  - Soil nutrient deficiencies
  - Crop type
- Reduces overuse of fertilizers and improves soil health.

---

 3. Irrigation Recommendation Model
- Recommends irrigation requirements based on:
  - Environmental conditions
  - Crop needs
- Helps in efficient water management and prevents over-irrigation.

---

 4. Crop Disease Prediction Model
- Predicts possible crop diseases using input features such as:
  - Crop condition data
  - Environmental factors
- Enables early detection of diseases to minimize crop damage.

---
 5. Pest Risk Prediction Model
- Predicts the risk level of pest attacks on crops.
- Helps farmers take preventive measures before severe infestation occurs.

---

 6. Pest Prevention Recommendation Function
- Based on the predicted pest risk, this function:
  - Suggests preventive actions
  - Recommends safe pest control methods
- Supports eco-friendly and effective pest management.
